# auto_arima
Arima model for general forecasting

Developed AutoArimaModel as a class wrapper for functionality in the pmdarima python package. Can be used for generic 
forecasting but currently does not include seasonality (may in the future). Also provided a basic unit test to see the 
auto-optimized model order on several stationary and non-stationary examples.
